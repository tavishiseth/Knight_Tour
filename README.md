# Knight_Tour

CS F372 Operating Systems
First Semester 2022-23

Problem Statement:
Write a C program (using C libraries for fork(), pthread and synchronisation) to solve the knight’s tour problem given an NxN board and the starting position of the knight. Given the starting position of the knight on an NxN board the starting position will be a coordinate (X, Y) with X and Y between (N=0…N-1). Print out a possible path the knight can take such that it covers all the squares (cells) in that board exactly once. If no such path is possible print “No Possible Tour”. The knight may move two cells vertically and one cell horizontally or two cells horizontally and one cell vertically. The program should be compatible on an Ubuntu machine running Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04. Please note the following details:    
1. 0<N<=50   
2. The value of N will be supplied as a command line argument.   
3. 0 <= X,Y < N the starting position of the knight on the grid, supplied as command line arguments, the positions are 0 indexed.  

So, your program should run as : ./knight.out N X Y  
The program should print a solved path of the tour. If no tour is possible from that start point print “No Possible Tour”. Otherwise print the (x,y) indexed position of the Knight at after each move in the tour till the entire tour is printed out.  
There can be multiple solutions for a given N X Y triplet. Printing one possible solution is sufficient.      

Examples:    

N = 5, X = 1, Y = 1  
Output:  
1,1|3,0|2,2|0,3|2,4|4,3|3,1|1,0|0,2|1,4|3,3|4,1|2,0|0,1|1,3|3,4|4,2|2,1|4,0|3,2|4,4|2,3|0,4|1,2|0,0|
  
N = 8, X = 3, Y = 2  
Output:  
3,2|5,3|7,4|6,6|4,7|2,6|0,7|1,5|3,6|5,7|4,5|3,7|1,6|0,4|2,5|4,6|6,7|5,5|7,6|6,4|5,6|7,7|6,5|4,4|2,3|3,5|2,7|0,6|1,4|3,3|5,2|4,0|6,1|7,3|5,4|7,5|6,3|7,1|5,0|3,1|1,0|0,2|2,1|0,0|1,2|2,0|0,1|1,3|3,4|4,2|3,0|1,1|0,3|2,2|4,1|6,0|7,2|5,1|7,0|6,2|4,3|2,4|0,5|1,7|
  
N = 3, X = 1, Y = 1  
Output:  
No Possible Tour  

Explanation: Knight is immobile at this position and can’t move to any cell.
